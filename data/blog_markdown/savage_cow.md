I walked towards the endless black of the night. On the outscurts of livi, i wasn't walking towards  the light and the bike, the spot that ends my day  when I'm lost and bored. Tonight's destination is a rando girl's bed that waited for me on the other side of busch. We walked together, me and this human. Who is this human? Who is Maha?

She looks like Zendaya, that's what I thought when I stumbled on her on that Friday night.

I was going about in pitty, looking for a great wind to carry me. The light and bike spot was an option, but it was too depressing. I wanted a wind that carries not a storm that burries. 


That's Jeremy and that's half Zendaya. I stumbled on them while waiting for the bus home. I was Wearing my mad men coat, trying to preform the draper role. Small but strong words and acts lol. Nothing about her seemed interesting. Apart from the confidence boost she supplied, she hadn't much to offer. Her outfit had no trace of effort. She asked for my snap which was flattering and enough to carry me.

She carried my pitty away, 2 days later I was carrying and kissing her inside of a random Douglass classroom. 6 days later, I was walking with her in the middle of the night, carrying her to her bed while she's joyfully screaming for a soft landing. 

The velocity on which our connection evolved is larger then that of the "soft" landing. I slammed her on the floor. It was euphoric, and surreal. Two days of "fucking", working, and napping. It felt like a dreamy wish washy Italian movie flooded with wine and sex, but it was real. 

Italian movies like that have no plot. They're sugar candy that looses the viewer's attention once the appeal is gone. 

Is Maha the personification of the wish washy Italian movie like la grande belleza or does it unfload a greater scence.

She just texted. Last thing I said, in a teasing way is I'll see you never since you know your security number and I don't need to supply it to you. 

> Yup keep it that way, she replied

I guess that's the end. 

$_{i .don't .want .it .to..end}$

**it is no the end :) she's a david flincher fight club**

Update from the future. She's not a David finisher. Not even close. She's a movie closed on itself,  doesn't want to be seen by others. Too afraid to form a bond. Terrified of critcs. Although she's a smart, hard working and beautiful, she's too absorbed in herself. I remember the morning when we were watching her TikTok, I asked her if you wanna see my tiktoks. Sure she blurped in the most disinterested manner. Nour would've screamed yes in joy.
